"""FastAPI surface over the Module 1 schema.

Deliberately thin. Two things it's built to demonstrate, because they're the interview
points the schema exists to make:

  1. Every write is the idempotent `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` upsert. The API
     computes content_hash server-side (one place, so clients can't disagree), so re-POSTing
     the identical signal is a no-op. That's the at-least-once story.
  2. The signals read REQUIRES an influencer + time window, so it always carries the
     partition key and prunes to the relevant month(s) instead of fanning across all of them.

The domain is Defrag's influencer watchlist: we track a set of creators (by Instagram
handle) and each scraped post/reel becomes a raw_signal. `last_scraped_at` on the influencer
is the incremental-scrape watermark, advanced via PATCH after each run.

Handlers are sync `def`, so FastAPI runs them in a threadpool and the sync psycopg pool
never blocks the event loop. One pool, opened at startup, closed at shutdown.

      - `progress`: one per influencer during the scrape phase.
      - `scrape_done`: the scrape chord fanned in and the rollup refreshed. If a model is in
        play the run is now in `rating` (NOT finished), and this is the cue to switch the UI
        from "scraping X/N" to "rating Y/M".
      - `rating`: one per signal rated, carrying rated/rate_total. Decoupled from the scrape
        chord by design (a slow model never blocks the fan-in), so these arrive after
        `scrape_done`.
      - `done`: the run reached a TERMINAL state. The worker owns this decision, it emits
        `done` at fan-in when there's no rating work, or when the last rating lands. The
        stream's only job is to relay deltas and close on `done`.

    The refresh-proof pattern, in order:
      1. subscribe to the Redis channel FIRST, so no delta published during step 2 is lost.
      2. read the runs row from Postgres and send it as the `snapshot` event. A client that
         connects late, or reconnects after a page refresh, gets the true current state here.
      3. if the run is already terminal on connect, send `done` and close.
      4. otherwise relay deltas and close when a `done` arrives.

    A refresh just reopens this endpoint. There's no per-user registration to lose: the run_id
    in the URL is the whole subscription, and the snapshot re-establishes state every time.
    (Reconnecting mid-rating-drain is safe: we subscribe before reading the snapshot, so the
    `done` that ends the rating phase either is already reflected in the snapshot as a terminal
    status, or arrives on the channel after we're listening.)

    This is a RELAY, two streams glued back to back. Upstream, the worker holds the

    The UI couples to our API only; which vendor runs the agent is the worker's secret.

    Event types, in the order a healthy run emits them:
      - `snapshot`: the digests row on connect (always first; refresh-proof state).
      - `status`: the worker created the session, carries session_id for the trace link.
      - `agent_message` / `tool` / `custom_tool` / `custom_tool_result`: narration,
        "what is the agent doing right now", for a ticker UI.
      - `done`: terminal verdict (completed/failed), decided by the WORKER after its
        final row check, because completion is judged by the database (the agent's PUT),
        never by how the transcript looked. Stream closes on it.

    Same refresh-proof choreography as /runs/{run_id}/stream: subscribe FIRST, then
    snapshot from Postgres, then relay; a client connecting after the run ended gets
    snapshot + done and closes without ever touching Redis history (there is none,
