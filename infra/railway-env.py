"""Railway env-var sync for the sysdesign project. IaC-lite.

The MANIFEST below is the source of truth for which variables each service gets
and where the value comes from. Secret values live in the repo-root .env (gitignored),
never here. Reference values (${{redis...}}) are Railway-side templates resolved
at deploy, so no secret ever passes through this file.

    python3 infra/railway-env.py list          # what's actually set on Railway right now
    python3 infra/railway-env.py sync --dry    # diff manifest vs remote, change nothing
    python3 infra/railway-env.py sync          # push manifest values

Auth is the project-scoped token (RAILWAY_PROJECT_TOKEN in the repo-root .env). It can
read/write variables and trigger deploys for this one project, nothing else.
